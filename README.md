🏦 MyBankDB Project – SQL Database System
📘 Overview

The MyBankDB project is a relational database system designed to simulate the core data structure and operations of a banking environment. It contains multiple interconnected tables representing customers, accounts, transactions, loans, credit cards, branches, and ATMs. The project demonstrates the use of SQL commands for data creation, retrieval, manipulation, and analysis.

🎯 Objectives

To design and implement a bank management database using SQL.

To perform data queries and joins for real-world banking operations.

To demonstrate data analysis, such as totals, averages, and grouping.

To show practical examples of subqueries, aggregate functions, and conditional logic.

🧩 Database Structure

The database mybankdb consists of the following main tables:

Customers – Stores customer details such as name, age, and ID.

Accounts – Contains account information (account type, balance, status).

Transactions – Records all financial activities related to accounts.

Loans – Holds loan details, including amount, interest rate, and duration.

CreditCards – Stores credit card information like credit limits and balances.

Branches – Represents different branch locations of the bank.

ATMs – Tracks ATM machines and their operational status.

⚙️ SQL Operations Demonstrated

Data Retrieval (SELECT) – Fetching complete table data and specific records.

Aggregate Functions – Using COUNT(), SUM(), AVG() to calculate totals and averages.

Filtering and Conditions – Using WHERE, BETWEEN, and comparison operators.

Joins – Combining data from multiple tables using INNER JOIN.

Subqueries – Finding nth highest values and nested query results.

Data Modification – Using DELETE to remove inactive records.

Date Functions – Calculating days remaining, filtering by specific dates, and showing current date/time.

Grouping and Categorization – Classifying customers by age group using CASE statements.

📊 Analytical Queries

Total number of customers and accounts.

Total loan and credit limit amounts.

Top 10 customers with the highest loan amounts.

Customers with multiple accounts.

Accounts and loans filtered by conditions (active, inactive, dates, amounts).

Average customer age and average credit card balance per customer.

Transactions summarized per month.

🧠 Key Concepts Highlighted

Relational database design and normalization.

Use of primary and foreign keys to link related data.

Query optimization through subqueries and aggregate functions.

Real-world financial data analysis using SQL.

✅ Conclusion

The MyBankDB project serves as a practical example of how SQL can be used to manage and analyze banking data efficiently. It integrates various SQL techniques—data retrieval, joins, aggregation, and categorization—making it a valuable learning tool for database management and financial analytics.
